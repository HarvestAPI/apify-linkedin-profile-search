## LinkedIn Profile Search Mass scraper

Our powerful tool helps you search all LinkedIn Profiles and filter by companies, job titles, locations and more without compromising security or violating platform policies.

### Key Benefits

- No cookies or account required: Access profile data without sharing cookies or risking account restrictions
- Fast response times deliver data in seconds ðŸš€
- No caching, fresh data.

## How It Works

1. Choose Profile Scraper Mode

- Short ($3 per 1000) will outputs full name, profile URL, summary, location, current positions.
- Full ($7 per 1000) will output full profile data including complete work experience, education, skills, and more.

2. Provide any combination of the following search parameters to find LinkedIn profiles:

- List of general search queries (approximate search). (e.g., `Founder`, `Marketing Manager`, `John Doe`)
- List of current Job titles (exact search) (e.g., `Marketing Manager`, `Data Scientist`)
- List of past Job titles (exact search) (e.g., `Marketing Manager`, `Data Scientist`)
- List of locations where they currently live (e.g., `New York`, `San Francisco`, `London`)
- List of LinkedIn Company URLs where they currently work (e.g., `google`, `meta`, `amazon`)
- List of LinkedIn Company URLs where they previously worked (e.g., `google`, `meta`, `amazon`)
- List of LinkedIn School URLs where they studied (e.g., `stanford-university`, `MIT`)

Other params (optionally):

- `maxItems` - Maximum number of profiles to scrape for all queries. If you set to 0, it will scrape all available items or up to 2500 items per search query (LinkedIn doesn't allow to extract more than 2500 per one query).

### Data You'll Receive

- Profile summary and headline
- Current and previous work experience
- Educational qualifications
- Location and contact information
- Skills and endorsements
- Recommendations and connections
- Certifications and projects

  "about": "I find myself at a unique crossroads where science meets compassion. With over eight years of experience in pharmacology, my journey has been fueled by a genuine desire to improve patient lives. Working at CVS Health has allowed me to interact with over 100 patients each week, guiding them through their health journeys not just by dispensing medications but by truly listening and building trust. It's incredibly rewarding to know I play a part in their well-being.\n\nIn my time as a Staff Pharmacist, Iâ€™ve exceeded daily production targets by 15% while ensuring timely service for more than 1,000 patients weekly. Collaborating with diverse pharmacy teams across Los Angeles has taught me the importance of understanding unique demographic needs. Whether itâ€™s addressing medication safety or enhancing patient satisfaction through targeted counseling initiatives, Iâ€™m dedicated to creating solutions that resonate.\n\nOne of my proudest moments was during my internship at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center when I administered over 1,500 immunizations. This experience opened my eyes to the impact preventive healthcare can have on communities. By conducting health screenings and engaging patients directly about disease management education, I contributed to improved public health outcomesâ€”something that drives me every day.\n\nOutside of my professional life, I have a passion for photography. This hobby allows me to express my creativity while honing my attention to detailâ€”skills that translate seamlessly into my work. Capturing moments behind the lens reminds me how important it is to appreciate the little things in life.\n\nIf you're interested in discussing innovative approaches in product development or project management within the healthcare fieldâ€”or if you simply want to chat about photographyâ€”I would love to connect! Feel free to reach out via emailâ€”letâ€™s explore how we can make an impact together.\n\nSkills:\n- Patient Care Management\n- Medication Optimization\n- Process Validation\n- Project Management\n- Drug Utilization Review",
